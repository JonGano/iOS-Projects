## Clima Weather App
This app was modeled after a project from the iOS and swift udemy course "The Complete iOS Developers Bootcamp".  Written in Swift, this utilizes the common MVC app structure.   Unlike the decade old legacy apps I've grown familiar with that share code from both Swift and Objective-C languages, this app is brand new and in a sense less complicated, but encompasses a lot of the basic tools and conventions that a larger application would have. It features the usage of delegate protocols, multiple classes, api calls, json parsing, dynamic UI, structs, switches, response blocks, Do-Catch blocks and error messages for bad calls or user input as well as thread safety techniques.  
  The goal of this app is to allow the user to either share their location or input the name of a city.  Once this is done the api call is made and weather data is retrieved and then parse to be displayed on the screen for the user.
